Working with Cloudinary API for the first time

You can run `npm start` to run the app.

You will need a .en file with the following data:

`REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
`REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`

The UX has 2 columns, on the left you upload the image and the one just uploaded is displayed. On the right, under the view port, the array of images gets display in lazy mode.
